DSOL - Distributed Simulation Object Library
               
    What is DSOL?
    
    * DSOL is an open source, Java based, suite for continuous and discrete event simulation.
     
    * Its first release was introduced at IEEE's Winter Simulation Conference 2002.

    * The starting points for DSOL were that it should be possible to create simulation models 
      that are inherently distributed, and simulation models that are built on the premises of object oriented principles.
      
    * DSOL is based on Zeigler's (2000) framework for modeling and simulation, which means that the basic entities
      in a simulation study are a model, and a simulator, governed for experimentation by and experimental frame. 
    
    * All these elements surface in the DSOL simulation framework: the ModelInterface, implemented by the user, 
      the SimulatorInterface with several implementations such as the DEVSSimulator and the DESSSimulator, and
      the class ExperimentalFrame for setting the experiment.

Implemented  formalisms
    
    At the moment, the following formalisms have been implemented in DSOL: event scheduling, process interaction, 
    differential equations, flow modeling, classical DEVS, Port-based DEVS, hierarchical DEVS, and agent modeling. 
    Extensions created by others (but currently still outside the core) contain for instance Petri Nets.


DSOL-HLA module

    DSOL-HLA is the module that contains simulation classes to use DSOL simulation models as a federate in an HLA federation.
    
    * Specific components are available for CERTI HLA
    
    * Time management functions and data management functions are provided
    
    * For now, only a conservative simulation clock has been implemented

DSOL License

	DSOL has an open source BSD 3-clause license.

    * Third party components used in DSOL can not have a license that is more restrictive than BSD, Apache, MIT, LGPL, Eclipse.

    * DSOL can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever).

    * DSOL may be extended, evolved by anyone into anything else for any purpose.
