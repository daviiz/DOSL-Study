/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for asynchronous communication. The event package is designed around three
 * interfaces:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The EventListenerInterface defining callback mechanism for a listener.</li>
 * <li>The EventProducerInterface defining registration capabilities.</li>
 * <li>The EventInterface defining the events which are sent by a producer and received by a listener.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In this package, two aspects are of crucial importance. Operations defined in the interfaces are prepared for
 * distribution. The event.remote package extends all listeners and producers to throw the <code>RemoteException</code>
 * on network problems. The second aspect is concurrency. The classes providing a reference implementation of these
 * interfaces are designed for multi-threaded deployment.
